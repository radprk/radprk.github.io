# Week of Jan 6, 2025

## goals
- Finish DDIA chapter 4
- 5 leetcode problems (focus on graphs)
- Build journal pipeline parser
- Start AI Engineering chapter 1

---

# Monday, Jan 6

## practice
- leetcode: Container With Most Water, medium - two pointers, always move the shorter side
- sql: Window functions on DataLemur - RANK vs DENSE_RANK clicked
- system design: URL shortener HLD - base62 encoding for short codes

## building
Journal pipeline - got the parser working, handles empty sections now

## reading
DDIA ch3 (pages 72-89) - LSM trees optimize for writes, B-trees better for reads

## exploring
Watched a video on gravitational lensing. Space itself bends, not just light's path through it. Wild.

## notes
Felt scattered today. Need to focus tomorrow - just leetcode and DDIA.

# Tuesday, Jan 7

## practice
- leetcode: Valid Parentheses, easy - stack is perfect for matching pairs
- leetcode: Trapping Rain Water, hard - two pointer approach, track max left and right heights
- ml: Gradient descent deep dive - learning rate too high = overshoot, too low = slow

## building
Journal pipeline - added Ollama integration, mistral extracts themes nicely

## reading
AI Engineering ch1 (pages 1-32) - Chip's framing of AI eng vs ML eng is useful

## exploring
Thinking about stoicism lately. The dichotomy of control feels relevant to job searching.

## notes
Better day. Focused blocks work.

# Wednesday, Jan 8

## practice
- leetcode: Number of Islands, medium - BFS/DFS to explore connected components
- leetcode: Clone Graph, medium - need to track visited nodes to avoid cycles
- sql: Subqueries practice - correlated vs non-correlated finally makes sense

## building
Journal pipeline - working on stats computation now

## reading
DDIA ch3 (pages 90-110) - finished the chapter, column-oriented storage for analytics is clever

---

# Thursday, Jan 9

## practice
- system design: Twitter feed design - fan-out on write vs read tradeoff

## reading
DDIA ch4 (pages 111-125) - started encoding chapter, JSON vs binary formats

## exploring
Found a cool podcast on the history of computing. ENIAC weighed 30 tons!

## notes
Lighter day, needed the break.

---

# Friday, Jan 10

## practice
- leetcode: Course Schedule, medium - topological sort using DFS
- ml: Backpropagation intuition - chain rule all the way down

## building
Journal pipeline - React frontend scaffolding started

## reading
AI Engineering ch1 (pages 33-40) - finished chapter 1

## notes
Productive week overall. Ready for the weekend.

## week-review
Goals hit: 3/4 - didn't finish DDIA ch4, but made good progress
Highlight: Ollama parsing works beautifully
Next week: Finish DDIA ch4, start on frontend polish
