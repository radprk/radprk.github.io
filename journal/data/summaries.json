    "narrative": "This week I dove deep into fundamentals — from hash maps and stacks to heaps and graphs. I explored how data systems handle storage through LSM trees and B-trees in DDIA, learned about fan-out strategies for Twitter's feed, and discovered that octopuses have three hearts. The brain-neuron-star connection blew my mind.",
